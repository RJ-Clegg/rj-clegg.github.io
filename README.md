# Privacy Policy for PageFlow

**Effective Date:** 21 October 2025  

PageFlow (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS app, **PageFlow**.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

We designed PageFlow to minimize data collection.

- **Personal data:** We do **not** collect names, email addresses, accounts, or contact lists.  
- **Reading data (library, progress, shelves):** Stored **locally on your device** and, if you enable it, synced privately via **Apple iCloud** to your Apple ID. We do **not** have access to your iCloud contents.  
- **Diagnostics & usage (optional/limited):** We may collect **anonymous, aggregate app usage and diagnostics** (e.g., screen interactions, crashes) to improve stability and user experience. This data is **not linked** to your identity and contains no book content.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

We use limited, non-identifying information to:

- Maintain and improve app functionality and performance  
- Diagnose crashes and usability issues  
- Support features like notifications and widgets  

We **do not sell, rent, or trade** your data.

---

## 3. Data Storage & Sync

- **On-device:** Your reading data (books, progress, shelves, preferences) is stored on your device. Widgets use Apple’s **App Group** storage to read this data locally.  
- **iCloud (if enabled):** Apple’s iCloud stores your library and reading progress in your own iCloud account so your data can be restored on reinstall and kept in sync across your devices signed into the **same Apple ID** with **iCloud enabled**.  
- **Our servers:** We do **not** host your reading data on our own servers.  

> Deleting PageFlow from your device does not delete data that already synced to iCloud. You can manage or delete iCloud data in **Settings → [your name] → iCloud**.

---

## 4. Permissions We Request

- **Camera:** Used **only** for barcode scanning to add books. Images or frames are never sent to our servers.  
- **Notifications:** Optional, to remind you about reading or updates you opt into.  
- **Network access:** For metadata lookups, cover art, and (if enabled) iCloud sync.

---

## 5. Analytics & Diagnostics

We may use privacy-focused analytics (e.g., **TelemetryDeck**) and Apple’s crash reporting to understand aggregate usage and stability. These events are **anonymous** and **not linked** to your identity or reading content.  
No advertising SDKs or cross-app trackers are used.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

PageFlow is **not directed to children under 13**, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 7. Your Choices

- **iCloud Sync:** You control iCloud in iOS Settings; disable it at any time.  
- **Notifications:** You can enable or disable notifications in iOS **Settings → Notifications**.  
- **Camera:** You can enable or disable camera access in **Settings → Privacy → Camera**.  
- **Export/Backup:** We plan to provide an **export/import** option after MVP so you can back up your data or move it elsewhere. When available, exports remain local to you.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here with a revised **Effective Date**.
